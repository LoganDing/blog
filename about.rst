The website is a collection of observations, thoughts, notes and side projects. A lot of the supporting code for the blog posts can be found in a public repo under my `github account <http://twitter.com/mattalcock>`_.

The website itself is written in restructured text and built with a small
script written by the very talented Armin Ronacher.  Sourcecode can be `found on github
